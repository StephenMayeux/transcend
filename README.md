***v.*** be or go beyond the range or limits of

A VR environment in which people across geographical boundaries can congregate, move around, explore, and interact as if they were actually together. It's a world that goes beyond traditional boundaries, allowing people from different places, situations, and walks of life to come together to share ideas and experiences.

## Why?

Social VR apps like [AltSpace](https://altvr.com/) and [vTime](https://vtime.net/) are redefining what it means to hang out with someone(s). Fullstack Academy has chosen Daydream as its VR platform of choice for its Remote Immersive program. However, vTime has only recently added Daydream support, and AltSpace still doesn't natively support Daydream. Both only allow small groups, up to six people/avatars, to join one "room" and hang out with each other.

As Mark Davis, Fullstack's Product Manager, describes [in a post about Fullstack's VR Lab](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/blog/vr-lab-jan-2017):

> Here’s what we wish existed, now: a simple VR environment where up to 25 avatars can interact with each other, with real-time voice chat, that’s accessible on a Google Daydream headset as an MVP, but is also extensible to any WebVR enabled headset.

This project serves to address that need. Transcend was built by [Joey Darbyshire](https://github.com/Jmikeydarby), [Sean McBride](https://github.com/spmcbride1201), [Yoo-Nah Park](https://github.com/parky22), and [Beth Qiang](https://github.com/bethqiang) as their Capstone Project during their Senior Phase at Fullstack Academy.

## How to Play
Transcend supports:
* keyboard/mouse controls on Chrome 56 or higher on a PC or Mac 

Note: Headset/controller controls on the Google Daydream coming soon.

### Keyboard and Mouse Controls:

#### Camera Movement:
* Lock Mouse: Click the 3d Scene
* Left and right turns the camera left and right
* Up and Down turns the camera up and down
* Unlock Mouse: Press ESC

#### Avatar Movement:
* Walk Forward: W or ⭡
* Walk Backwards: S or ⭣
* Sidestep Left: A or ⭠
* Sidestep Right: S or ⭢

#### Cursor:
The ring in the center of your screen represents your cursor, which is your tool for interacting with the world. Certain elements in the world responds to your cursor hovering over a selectable object for one continuous second. You know that an object is responding to your cursor when it glows a transluscent blue, similar to an HTML hyperlink.

### Teleporters:
* Teleporters are the way we move between VR scenes. They cause you to leave one scene and enter another. 
* Teleporters are orbs and they usually have a label representing where they lead. 
* Teleporters highlight blue like a hyperlink when you hover your cursor over them. 
* If you stay hovered to keep it highlighted for one second, the teleporter activates, taking you to the other scene.

### Costumes in 'The Gap'
In this VR universe, The Gap is where the fashion happens. Hover your cursor over a mannequin wearing an avatar you like, and you'll notice a translucent blue cylinder appear around it. After one second, you should hear a voice confirming that you now are that avatar. Talk about Fast Fashion!

### UI Wheel:
When you are in game, look down where your feet would be and you'll notice a button. No, it's not for your [Reebok Pumps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reebok_Pump). C'mon, you can't even jump in this world! The button mutes your in-game microphone. Start at it for a second, and you'll see the button change between recording and muted states. Hope you can hold your sneeze that long!
