***v.*** be or go beyond the range or limits of

A VR environment in which people across geographical boundaries can congregate, move around, explore, and interact as if they were actually together. It's a world that goes beyond traditional boundaries, allowing people from different places, situations, and walks of life to come together to share ideas and experiences.

## Why?

Social VR apps like [AltSpace](https://altvr.com/) and [vTime](https://vtime.net/) are redefining what it means to hang out with someone(s). Fullstack Academy has chosen Daydream as its VR platform of choice for its Remote Immersive program. However, vTime has only recently added Daydream support, and AltSpace still doesn't natively support Daydream. Both only allow small groups, up to six people/avatars, to join one "room" and hang out with each other.

As Mark Davis, Fullstack's Product Manager, describes [in a post about Fullstack's VR Lab](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/blog/vr-lab-jan-2017):

> Here’s what we wish existed, now: a simple VR environment where up to 25 avatars can interact with each other, with real-time voice chat, that’s accessible on a Google Daydream headset as an MVP, but is also extensible to any WebVR enabled headset.

This project serves to address that need. Transcend was built by [Joey Darbyshire](https://github.com/Jmikeydarby), [Sean McBride](https://github.com/spmcbride1201), [Yoo-Nah Park](https://github.com/parky22), and [Beth Qiang](https://github.com/bethqiang) as their Capstone Project during their Senior Phase at Fullstack Academy.
